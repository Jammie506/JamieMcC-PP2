## Word Processing Online Exam - Proof of Concept

Love Swimming is a website that aims to provide a smooth and friendly way for people to start swimming, improve their skills or just make new friends. The site will be primarily targeted towards adults living and working in and around Dublin City Centre. The site will allow users to join tailor-made classes to begin lessons or to improve their fitness and swimming abilities.

The site will also allow users to set up their own “Community Meets”, allowing for the growth of the community into more specialized training sections for all abilities and styles. Love Swimming will also be useful for swimmers to progress their skills in the water to their desired level, whether this would be to join a more competitive team to compete in races or simply to feel more confident in the water on holidays.

## Features

* Navigation Bar
    * In place at the top of all pages, this allows users to easily navigate the entire site without the need to use external controls, such as the browser “Previous Page” or “Back” button.
    * The simplistic design of the Navigation Bar clearly outlines all that is available for visitors to the site, both on Mobile and Desktop.
    * The Navigation Bar has been designed to automatically hide using CSS on smaller screens, to be replaced with a menu icon, in order to prevent visual overcrowding.

* Home Page
    * The home page includes a large “Hero Image” that draws the user’s attention, encouraging them to remain on the site.
    * The use of bright colours also served to catch the user’s attention by creating a visually appealing page.
    * On large screens the page is laid out in such a way that users can see some of the content below the hero image, encouraging them to scroll to read it. This can increase the amount of time that the user remains on the site.

* Benefits of Swimming
    * This section outlines some of the reasons that users may be interested in joining the club.
    * The various and wide-ranging information should help to encourage a wider audience of people to become interested in the club.

## Features to be Implemented

* Form Submissions
    * The ability for Learners to submit a copy of their responses to their teacher to allow for more in-depth marking and corrections/ instructions is planned for future releases.

## Testing

* A majority of the testing for this website was conducted using the Responsive Screen Size tool within Google Chrome’s dev mode. This allowed me to ensure that the design elements all worked across different simulated screen sizes. This also allowed for stress testing of the site by rapidly changing the size of the screen.
* The site was deployed via GitHub Pages to ensure that there were no issues that occurred between the initial development stage and the full launch of the page. Some issues were encountered during this phase and were thus resolved.
* The site was tested accross a number of devices once deployed. These devices include and iPhone 12 Pro Max, a MacBook Pro and a Samsung Galaxy Phone.

## Validator Testing

* HTML
    * No major errors were found when testing through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjammie506.github.io%2FJamieMcC-PP2%2Findex.html)
    * One warning that remains on the page relates to the use of tags in the Exam Questions as all questions are left hidden by default: "The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control."
* CSS
    * No errors were found when testing through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

## Unfixed Bugs

* No unresolved bugs were found at this point during testing

## Deployment 

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
